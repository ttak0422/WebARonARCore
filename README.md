# WebARonARCore

**An experimental app for Android that lets developers create Augmented Reality (AR) experiences using web technologies.**

**Note:** This is not an official Google product. Nor is it a fully-featured web browser. Nor are the enabling JavaScript APIs standards, or on the standardization path. WebARonARCore is only meant to enable developer experimentation.

An [iOS version](https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARKit) is also available.

## <a name="Getting started">Getting started</a>

WebARonARCore can be [installed from an APK](#InstallingAPK), or [built from source](#CompileFromSource).

### <a name="SupportedDevices">Supported devices</a>
WebARonARCore is built on top of Android [ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar), which requires an ARCore-compatible Android device. For best results, we recommend:

* Google Pixel or Pixel XL
* Samsung Galaxy S8

### <a name="InstallingAPK">Option 1: Install the APK</a>
* Plug your device into a USB slot on your computer
* Verify that ADB can see the device with `$ adb devices`. You should see your device in the output. If not (adb can be flaky), keep unplugging your device and plugging it back in until it shows up.
* Download the ARCore APK from [here](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/releases/download/sdk-preview/arcore-preview.apk). You can also go to [https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/releases/download/sdk-preview/arcore-preview.apk](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/releases/download/sdk-preview/arcore-preview.apk) using a browser on your Android device and download and install it directly.
* Download the WebARonARCore APK from [here](https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARCore/blob/webarcore_57.0.2987.5/apk/WebARonARCore.apk). You can also go to [https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARCore/blob/webarcore_57.0.2987.5/apk/WebARonARCore.apk](https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARCore/blob/webarcore_57.0.2987.5/apk/WebARonARCore.apk) using a browser on your Android device and download and install it directly.
* If you downloaded the ARCore APK, install it to your device: `$ adb install -r arcore_preview.apk`
* If you downloaded the WebARonARCore APK, install it to your device: `$ adb install -r WebARonARCore.apk`
* Launch the WebARonARCore app from your device.

### <a name="CompileFromSource">Option 2: Compile from Source</a>
#### Clone the git repo and prepare it to be built

Instructions for [cloning and building Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/android-build-instructions) are available at [chromium.org](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/android-build-instructions)

Prerequisites:

* Linux machine
* GIT
* Python

We recommend you follow the following steps.

1. Open a terminal window
2. Install depot_tools. You can follow this [tutorial](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up) or simply follow these 2 steps:
  * `git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git`
  * `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/depot_tools`
3. Create a folder to contain `chromium` and move to it: `$ mkdir ~/chromium && cd ~/chromium`
4. Checkout the Chromium repo: `~/chromium$ fetch --nohooks android`. **Note**: This process may take a long time (an hour?)
5. Enter the `src` folder: `$ cd src`.
6. Add this git repo as a remote (we are going to call it 'github'): `git remote add github https://github.com/google-ar/WebARonARCore.git`
7. Fetch the newly added remote: `git fetch github`
8. Checkout the webarcore branch from the github remote: `git checkout --track github/webarcore_57.0.2987.5`
9. Synchronize the dependencies with this command: `~/chromium/src$ gclient sync --disable-syntax-validation`. **Note**: This process may take some time too.
10. Create a folder where to make the final product compilation: `~/chromium/src$ mkdir -p out/master` (you will need to create a folder matching the name of your branch, in this case `webarcore_57.0.2987.5`).
11. Create and edit a new file `out/webarcore_57.0.2987.5/args.gn`. Copy and paste the following content in the `args.gn` file:
```
  target_os = "android"
  target_cpu = "arm64"
  is_debug = false
  is_component_build = true
  enable_webvr = true
  proprietary_codecs = false
  ffmpeg_branding = "Chromium"
  enable_nacl = false
  remove_webcore_debug_symbols = true
```
12. Prepare to build: `~/chromium/src$ gn args out/webarcore_57.0.2987.5`. **Note**: once the command is executed, the vi editor will show you the content of the `args.gn` file just edited a few steps before. Just exit by pressing ESC and typing colon and `x`.
13. Install the build dependencies: `~/chromium/src$ build/install-build-deps-android.sh`
14. Synchronize the resources once again: `~/chromium/src$ gclient sync --disable-syntax-validation`
15. Setup the environment: `~/chromium/src$ . build/android/envsetup.sh`

#### 2. Build, install and run

The line below not only compiles Chromium but also installs the final APK on to a connected device and runs it, so it is convenient that you to connect the device via USB before executing it. The project that will be built by default is the Chromium WebView project, the only one that has been modified to provide AR capabilities.
```
~/chromium/src$ ./build_install_run.sh
```
You can review the content of the script to see what it does (it is a fairly simple script) but if you would like to compile the final APK on your own you could do it by executing the following command:
```
~/chromium/src$ ninja -C out/webarcore_57.0.2987.5
```

The final APK will be built in the folder `~/chromium/src/out/webarcore_57.0.2987.5/apks`.

## <a name="HowWebARonARCoreWorks">How WebARonARCore works</a>

WebARonARCore is built of two essential technologies: ARCore and Chromium. We also extend the WebVR 1.1 API, which gives us much of what we need for augmented reality, with a few more essentials, such as motion tracking, rendering of the camera's video feed, and basic understanding of the real world. For details, see [WebVR API extension for smartphone AR](https://github.com/google-ar/three.ar.js/blob/master/webvr_ar_extension.md)

## <a name="KnownIssues">Known issues</a>
* The current implementation of WebAR is built on top of the Chromium WebView flavor. This has some implementation advantages but some performance and use disadvantages. We are working on making the implementation on a full version of Chromium.
* Pausing/resuming/switching away from the app causes screen to turn black. This is a consequence of having built the implementation on top of the WebView flavor of Chromium. A proper implementation on full Chromium or a rebase to a more recent Chromium WebView version (>57.0.2987.5) might solve this problem.

## <a name="FutureWork">Future work</a>
* Add more AR-related features.
* Adapt the implementation to the WebVR 2.0 spec proposal.
* Implement the prototype on full Chromium (not on the WebView flavor) and to a newer tag version (>57.0.2987.5).
* Improve the VRPassThroughCamera rendering pipeline either making it obscure for the developer or by using regular WebGL textures and shader samplers without having to use the external image texture extension.
